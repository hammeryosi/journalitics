[{"title": "Boy, I'm Scared! The 10 best 'Twilight Zone' episodes on Syfy", "author": "Michael Starr", "summary": "It's not only showing all 156 episodes of Rod Serling's classic CBS series, in chronological order - \"TZ\" aired from 1959 to '64 - but it's airing them in HD. (That probably won't make much of a difference for a black-and-white series from this era, but still . . .) This parable of life and death, decided in a seedy pool room (city unknown), features two actors with terrific chops and even better chemistry: Jack Klugman as Jesse Cardiff, the self-proclaimed best pool player on Randolph Street, and Jonathan Winters as the dead pool legend James Howard \"Fats\" Brown (\"The best who ever was\"). Fats materializes from pool-player heaven and challenges Jesse to a game. The stakes? If Jesse wins, he lives. If he loses, he dies. The banter between Klugman and Winters (stepping outside his comic comfort zone) is priceless. (And the timing was perfect: The episode aired shortly after the big-screen premiere of \"The Hustler,\" co-starring Jackie Gleason as pool legend Minnesota Fats.) This one still creeps me out. Evil youngster Anthony Fremont (Billy Mumy, later to star in \"Lost in Space\") holds his family and small Ohio town hostage by killing anyone who doesn't think good thoughts about him (or anything else) - turning them into something hideous before \"wishing\" them to a nearby cornfield. One of Anthony's neighbors gets drunk at a birthday party and mouths off about the young lad. Bad move. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
