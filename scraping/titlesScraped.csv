(That probably won't make much of a difference for a black-and-white series from this era, but still . . .) This parable of life and death, decided in a seedy pool room (city unknown), features two actors with terrific chops and even better chemistry: Jack Klugman as Jesse Cardiff, the self-proclaimed best pool player on Randolph Street, and Jonathan Winters as the dead pool legend James Howard ""Fats"" Brown (""The best who ever was""). Fats materializes from pool-player heaven and challenges Jesse to a game. The stakes? If Jesse wins, he lives. If he loses, he dies. The banter between Klugman and Winters (stepping outside his comic comfort zone) is priceless. (And the timing was perfect: The episode aired shortly after the big-screen premiere of ""The Hustler,"" co-starring Jackie Gleason as pool legend Minnesota Fats.) This one still creeps me out. Evil youngster Anthony Fremont (Billy Mumy, later to star in ""Lost in Space"") holds his family and small Ohio town hostage by killing anyone who doesn't think good thoughts about him (or anything else) - turning them into something hideous before ""wishing"" them to a nearby cornfield. One of Anthony's neighbors gets drunk at a birthday party and mouths off about the young lad. Bad move. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

He immediately became Alabama's No. 1 wide receiver that evening against Georgia, ranked eighth in the nation at the time, hauling in five catches for 120 yards and a touchdowns. He would have two more 100-yard receiving games, against Arkansas and Florida, during the regular season. And then came Thursday night, Ridley turning AT&T Stadium into his personal playground.  The cards were stacked against Ridley to make an impact this year. He played just three high-school games as a senior, because of Florida's age limits, which don't allow anyone over the age of 19 and nine months to be eligible to play. He didn't enroll at Alabama until the fall semester, late for most top football prospects. And he suffered a rib injury in the season opener against Wisconsin, an injury he still feels.

A journey where I've had the ability to kind of see some mountaintops. I've traveled through some valleys, because there's been times where we've really been successful as an organization ... and times where we just haven't. I've had different guidance along the way, at all levels, at all stages. And I think I've developed during that journey personally. Because as I traveled I learned some things through my experiences. So all in all, I'm pleased I have the opportunity to continue down this path, and I'm excited to see where it takes me. A: Personally, from an individual standpoint, when you get voted to the Pro Bowl ... I think as a team, the fact that we were able to beat some very good opponents in our playoff run. As far as some of the valleys, there's been some years, especially early on, where I don't feel maybe people had confidence in what I could do. So that's hard when you feel like you're traveling an uphill journey. And I think, as a team, there's been some real tough years where we've had some negative seasons, where we just couldn't figure out how to get out of the rut. It wasn't for a lack of effort. It wasn't for a lack of want-to. It was just what it was at that time, and I think that could be really challenging, because you don't exactly know what you're doing wrong. A: I don't know if it was any one person, but it could be just the lack of confidence. ... I don't know if I was held in the highest light as far as what I could do. Maybe there were many expectations coming in as a top pick. ... Maybe not having that immediate success, it felt like I was fighting an uphill battle, but when I was able to reach that mountaintop experience. ... During that time when I went to the Pro Bowl, we'd faced a lot of top opponents that I had to battle. The one thing about this game or this position is when you're on that field, there's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to go.

The Spartans dared [Jake Coker] to beat them, stacking the box against [Derrick Henry], and Coker obliged, with the best performance of his career. It's hard not to feel good for Coker, a selfless leader his teammates swear by who has waited until his fifth year of college to finally get this opportunity, three years as a backup at Florida State and one at Alabama.

Jack is making $6.3 million this season and the Nets have a team option on his $6.3 million salary next year, with only $500,000 guaranteed. But the Nets are in rebuild mode, Jack is 32 and has been picked by the annual NBA GM survey as one of the five players who would make the best coach, so his future is in question. What isn't in question is how much he would have helped this season, after the Nets gave away their likely lottery pick to Boston and have no incentive to lose. Jack averaged 12.8 points and a team- and career-high 7.4 assists. That doesn't begin to tell the tale of his importance to this team. Jack was the only player to come to Brook Lopez's defense Saturday after he was horse-collared and thrown down by Boston's Jared Sullinger, or to check on Thaddeus Young when he dove into the front row for a loose ball.

Befitting his direct style, Coughlin after his final team meeting met with Giants co-owners John Mara and Steve Tisch and ""informed them that it is in the best interest of the organization that I step down as head coach."" This was the expected course of action, as Coughlin made it easy on ownership by resigning with one year remaining on his contract, one day after the Giants finished 6-10 for the second straight season, putting the playoffless streak at four consecutive years. It nevertheless was a stunning turn of events, as Coughlin, 69, was on the scene for 12 years, produced two Super Bowl victories for the franchise and is a likely future inductee into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. ""It is difficult to come up with words adequate to describe the appreciation we have for everything Tom Coughlin has done for our franchise,"" Mara said. ""In addition to delivering two Super Bowl titles, Tom represented us with class and dignity, and restored the pride to our entire organization. He has all the qualities you could ever ask for in a head coach, and set very high standards for whoever will succeed him."" Succeeding Coughlin will not be easy and replacing him is a crucial move for Mara and [Jerry Reese], who returns despite a deterioration of the talent level on the roster. Offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo will be considered and the Giants must work quickly, as there are multiple openings throughout the NFL and teams are already lining up candidates for interviews.

And don't forget the corollary Coughlin Beliefs, which included the notion that injuries were a ""cancer"" that were ""mainly mental"" (an observation that would haunt him later on).

Barring such discipline, it's irrelevant. So it's not a matter of whether I think or don't think Bagwell used illegal PEDs. I simply don't care. And his offensive numbers (.948 OPS and 149 OPS+) speak for themselves. Will he break Tom Seaver's record of 98.84 percent support? I'm betting yes, for two reasons: 1. The elimination of about 90 voters who hadn't covered the game for 10 or more years seems to have removed much crankiness from the electorate; and 2. [Ken Griffey Jr.], who possesses no known ties to illegal PEDs, looks even better thanks to his less shiny contemporaries like [Barry Bonds]. In any case, Junior's overall accomplishments make him a slam dunk. Tim Raines is my 11th choice. I've voted for Mark McGwire in the past, and I'd vote for Gary Sheffield in the future. Sammy Sosa's 2003 suspension for a corked bat works against him. It's hard to support closers Trevor Hoffman, Lee Smith and Billy Wagner with the current logjam.

If I'm [Mike Maccagnan], I'd offer him a three-year, $30 million deal with $15 million guaranteed in the first two years. If it takes a little more guaranteed money to get the deal done, do it. If he stumbles in 2016 or '17, you cut him before 2018. This is not like last year when the Jets had $50 million in cap space. They are projected to have about $16-18 million in cap space at the moment. If you franchise [MUHAMMAD WILKERSON], that is basically your entire spending. So, Maccagnan must find some room. Start by renegotiating tackle D'Brickashaw Ferguson's contract. Ferguson's cap number is $14 million in 2016. He is still a serviceable left tackle, but no longer one of the best in the league. Ferguson needs to take a pay cut. If you can get him for $7 million-$8 million per year with guaranteed money for just two years, that would work.

Coughlin, meanwhile, proved himself the anti-Belichick. He didn't dominate the NFC East during his 12 years. But when he made the playoffs, he made it count - especially against the Patriots.

""In Israel, LGBTs are now part of the military and business and political systems; we are everywhere. My party, the Likud, is Israel's largest - and it's natural that we are there, too.""

That way of life has worked out fairly well for Saban. Monday night, he won his fifth national championship, as Alabama beat Clemson 45-40 in Glendale, Ariz.-site of the Giants' titanic upset of the Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. Making an inquiry about Saban would be a bold and un-Giantslike maneuver. It is also probably a fruitless endeavor. Saban makes $7 million a year as the highest paid college football coach in the country and to get him out of Tuscaloosa, an NFL team would have to far exceed that figure. When he signed a contract extension a few years ago, Saban said it represented ""a commitment to the University of Alabama for the rest of our career,"" referring to himself and his wife. ""If we had Drew Brees, I might still be in Miami,"" Saban said. The Dolphins in 2006, unsure if Brees' shoulder was healthy, eschewed Brees in free agency and opted to trade for Daunte Culpepper.

It falls upon Cespedes' representatives at Roc Nation Sports and Upton's agent Larry Reynolds to turn those signals north. It could be, as an executive from an AL club put it, ""A few guys overplayed their hands."" Regarding Cespedes, teams could be wary of his up-and-down on-base percentage, which registered .294 in 2013 and .301 in 2014 before rising to .328 last year.

[Ben McAdoo], the offensive coordinator the past two years working for Tom Coughlin, was given a four-year contract, tasked to get the Giants back into Super Bowl contention after four consecutive years out of the playoffs and three straight losing seasons. McAdoo will change much of the operation after 12 years of Coughlin's reign, but this is a hire from within and not an organizational clean slate. Looking back on his rsum, including eight years in the Packers' organization, McAdoo said, ""I'm hardened, battle tested and I've been groomed for this opportunity by Super Bowl winning coaches, players and organizations."" He described himself as ""baptized by fire."" ""Thinking of a way to honor Tom,"" McAdoo said.

The contenders took turns blasting Obama's failure to even acknowledge the role of Islam, and promised to destroy Islamic State instead of merely trying to contain it. The emerging clarity on the Democratic side comes with a twist. The dead heat in Iowa between [Hillary Clinton] and Sen. Bernie Sanders adds to the belief that Clinton is going backward. She's behind in New Hampshire, and her team is touting a ""firewall"" in the South, suggesting they are lowering public expectations and their own goals for the first two tests. Coming on top of the widespread doubts about Clinton's integrity and the greater enthusiasm among Sanders' supporters, the FBI probe has the potential to fatally wound her. Even the stock-market chaos and economic slowdown work against her because of her long ties to Wall Street, and because of Sanders' socialist screeds. Although the RealClearPolitics average of national polls has her ahead by nearly 9 points, a Sanders win in both Iowa and New Hampshire would shatter any sense of inevitability.

It wasn't pretty, it certainly wasn't easy, and it appeared costly as rookie Kristaps Porzingis exited late in the fourth quarter with a right foot injury. ""The game was never really over,"" Knicks coach Derek Fisher said. ""They just kept playing."" For the Sixers (5-38), Jahlil Okafor (20 points) was an offensive force early. Ish Smith (16 points, 16 assists, despite 8-of-28 shooting) was a penetrating machine. Nerlens Noel (18 points) was a second-half brute, and the likes of Isaiah Canaan (16 points) and Robert Covington (11 points) continually hit big shots. Okafor came out in the third quarter and never returned as Philadelphia coach Brett Brown went with small-ball-and Noel. ""I live for moments like that."" Canaan missed a desperate heave, and the first overtime saw more of the roller-coaster scenario. The Sixers went up four behind Smith. The Knicks rallied and, on 7-of-7 free-throw shooting, led by three with under 10 seconds left. This time, Covington pulled the ""Great Escape"" act and banked a 25-footer with 7.4 seconds left.

Clinton wasn't always universally beloved in his own party - and for similar ""me-first"" reasons. There was major pushback when he and other moderate (primarily Southern) senators and governors formed the Democratic Leadership Council after the party's far-left wing led it to electoral wipeouts in 1972 (when Clinton worked on the McGovern campaign), 1980, 1984 and 1988. Jesse Jackson dismissed the DLC as ""Democrats for the Leisure Class.""  Same goes for foreign policy: Cruz has played up his criticism of ""neo-cons"" - a tactic that lets him criticize both the more explicitly hawkish Marco Rubio and [Hillary Clinton] (a two-fer much like ""New York values"" works against Hillary and The Donald simultaneously).

Love, to get back to [Terry Collins]' words, is in the eye of the beholder, and the Mets understandably still behold only vague mentions of a short-term deal with their prized 2015 trade acquisition. On Tuesday night, Mets general manager Sandy Alderson told season-ticket holders, ""We continue to have conversations with Cespedes' agent.

These are the Mets, which means that of course their own rental-stud Cespedes takes the longest to sign - intensifying the desires of rabid Mets fans who, understandably again, just don't trust the folks who operate the club's purse strings. Of course they did everything right to land their top choice Ben Zobrist besides 1) not hiring Zobrist's old manager Joe Maddon a year ago and 2) not moving their team closer to the Nashville area where Zobrist makes his offseason home, and they therefore get zero credit.

Spade has an extensive paper trail of having Israeli groups banned from American LGBT events, including a particularly embarrassing 2012 incident that required a formal apology from the City of Seattle's LGBT Commission.  This time, in place of contrition, Creating Change has invoked now-ubiquitous clichs such as ""constructive dialogue"" and ""safe space"" to defend both rejecting and re-welcoming A Wider Bridge. How a group's banishment and then reinvitation could possibly both be done under the rubric of creating a safe space has gone unexplained.  Feckless and reckless, Creating Change has proven, yet again, that LGBT inclusiveness stops at Israel's front door. In doing so, they've not only handed a victory to the extremist academy, but allowed theory and emotion to triumph over free speech, critical thinking and a true marketplace of ideas. This isn't about Israelis or Arabs, Muslims or Jews - but a system that rewards fear, placates bullies and privileges shrieking and shrillness over intelligent discourse and reasoned debate.

American oak, Italian stone and glass walls are just some touches included in the pads' interiors. But every condo will come with wraparound terraces from 15 to 25 feet wide that look out to panoramic vistas. Eighty Seven Park will also be packed with amenities - including a spa, salon, library and an enoteca for wine and food - but the most notable are its green features. The lobby will have a leafy orangery, plus a year-round botanical exhibit with orchids and cacti. Can't wait for a building construction to finish? That's okay.

The Steven G.-designed interiors feature white-gloss porcelain and bleached hardwood flooring, Duravit bathrooms and fixtures, glass-enclosed elevators and - with a big nod to area Jewish residents - kosher kitchens, which also have name-brand appliances.

Sorry, Los Angeles, you can't have him. Knicks owner James Dolan won't let go of president Phil Jackson just yet.

[Arron Afflalo] and [Robin Lopez] were Jackson's top two free-agent signings. The tandem is earning its keep after slow starts. [Carmelo Anthony] trusts his former Denver playoff mate more than he has trusted any teammate, including Smith. Anthony's cross-court bullet to Afflalo for a 3-poiner late in regulation in Wednesday's 118-111 overtime win over Utah was a perfect illustration. ""I think as he's gotten more comfortable as the season's gone on, understanding where those opportunities will come from in this particular offense,"" coach Derek Fisher said of Lopez.

Cespedes' eccentric personality, the same personality that had Mets fans more than happy to bid him good riddance following a bad World Series, ultimately worked to the Mets' advantage. He really did want to come back to his fourth employer, it turned out. So much so that, even after an offer from the rival Nationals hit the nine-figure mark, Cespedes instructed his representatives at Roc Nation Sports to call the Mets and talk through that three-year deal. The Mets? The Mets far exceeded their primary goal, which was not to take too much of a public-relations beating from Cespedes' departure. They get back their middle-of-the-lineup force and consequently, arguably, become the clear favorites to defend their National League East title.

This isn't January 2007, when Manning threw for 349 yards and brought the Colts back from a 21-3 deficit at Indianapolis for a 38-34 victory. This isn't November 2009, when Bill Belichick was so spooked by Manning that he went for it on fourth-and-2 from his own 28 with a six-point lead and 2:08 remaining. And didn't get it. And lost. This will be Jan. 24, 2016, when Brady still is playing at a level no quarterback could play - not even Joe Montana, not even John Unitas, not even John Elway. And Manning, back after two months of rehab, is playing the way 39-year-old quarterbacks historically play. Belichick won't be afraid to dare Manning to beat him while at the same time asking Brady to go win it. It was Elway who set the bar when, at ages 37 and 38, he finally delivered Super Bowl championships to Denver. That was 17 years ago. Manning's mandate when Elway sold him on the Broncos was to deliver another one. Manning took a $4 million paycut before this season. And now the $15 million question is whether he can fashion an Elway ending. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Earlier this season, Brady's regular-season loss here was finalized without access to Julian Edelman or Danny Amendola ... and against Brock Osweiler (not Manning). Manning has beaten Brady in two of their four playoff meetings ... once in Indianapolis as a Colt in the game leading to Manning's lone Super Bowl win, and the other, two years ago, as a Bronco, in a game in which Gronkowski didn't play.  Referee Ed ""Guns"" Hochuli has been assigned this match. The Broncos have exceeded expectations in their games Hochuli's worked since 2008 (6-0), and the Patriots are just 3-4 in Hochuli games since 2010. Home teams have covered under Hochuli's oversight at a 71 percent clip (higher than the league average) - and underdogs have covered at 59 percent when Hochuli's wearing the white cap.

For the moment, though, I'll put the Mets above Washington, which has whiffed this winter in efforts to add Cespedes, Jason Heyward and Ben Zobrist. Now, Mets general manager Sandy Alderson made clear recently - when it appeared that re-signing Cespedes was a long shot - he didn't view Cespedes as a great fit in center field. He isn't. Yet if you watched Cespedes patrol center field during his time with the Mets, you know that, with the exception of two profoundly bizarre misplays in the World Series, he didn't embarrass himself out there (and he should play left field against lefties, with the superior Juan Lagares patrolling center field). The same can be said for the Mets' new middle infielders [Neil Walker] and [Asdrubal Cabrera], neither of whom will wow you with their range but - unlike their immediate predecessors Daniel Murphy and [Wilmer Flores]- will make the plays they should make.

Now, the Mets' best lineup against right-handers will feature [Cespedes], who hits righties better than southpaws even though he bats from the right side, in center field. De Aza basically will hang around as a pinch-hitter and injury reserve. The Mets should at least explore a trade of him. Lagares is signed through 2019 on an extremely team-friendly contract - he will make a total of $22.5 million over the next four seasons. Because Cespedes probably will opt out of his contract after this coming season, it wouldn't behoove the Mets to sell low on Lagares after his discouraging 2015.

[Peyton Manning]'s incomplete pass in the left flat off Ronnie Hillman's hands was then ruled a fumble recovery by Jonathan Freeny at the Manning 22, and soon it was 7-6 because Stephen Gostkowski, of all kickers, missed the second PAT of his career. Sanders broke open down the middle on first down, but Manning overthrew him in the end zone. No problem. On third and 9, Manning's feathery touch pass found Daniels past Jamie Collins in the right corner of the end zone for the 12-yard TD that made it Manning 14, Brady 6.

Sure, he knew all about Hall's problems - in late November 2012, he was one of four Hofstra men's basketball players arrested and charged with felony burglary after admitting to stealing more than $10,000 worth of laptop computers, iPads and other items from fellow students - and initially the plan was to recruit him for down the road. Hall was attending ASA junior college in Brooklyn at the time. ""To see him become successful and do well and stay on the right track and produce, it's something I root for,"" said Steve DeMeo, a former Hofstra assistant who is now coaching at junior college Northwest Florida. ""I'm happy for Jimmy Hall."" The Zags' run of 17 NCAA Tournament berths could be in jeopardy.

When Weiner reads an editorial defending him about all the things he didn't do - didn't rape anyone, didn't sexually assault anyone, didn't commit adultery, didn't misuse his office, etc. - many of the allegations have credibly been made against Bill Clinton. (There is a minute or two of film considering news reports that Hillary might have demanded Abedin distance herself from Weiner if she wanted to keep her job.) Throughout the film, Weiner displays an arrogance as swollen as his briefs, responding to a random detractor in a bakery who calls him a ""scumbag"" that ""it takes one to know one,"" then getting in a shouting match with the citizen. When his own polling expert tells him he has zero chance of victory and is bailing, Weiner refuses to listen to reason and muses about saving himself via a ""Bulworth"" moment of unhinged hard-left appeals. He is seen chuckling at video of his disastrous, out-of-control interview with MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell, while a disbelieving Abedin asks, ""Why are you laughing?"" After his concession speech, Weiner is photographed giving the finger to photographers.  Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

""It's not just that he won't spend a minute in college, he shouldn't. He's a physical freak. There's only one league for a guy like that, and it's not the Big East."" LeBron James proved worthy of all the advance billing. You can haggle with some aspects of his game, still, 13 years later. You can argue with how he sometimes carries himself. But from the moment we became aware of him as a high school kid, this was never in dispute: Bill Parcells, from 2012: ""That kid is a specimen, a physical freak."" Jon Gruden, from 2011: ""Jaw-dropping talent.A physical freak."" Bruce Arians, Sunday night: ""When he gets it going, there's nobody like him."" Funny thing, too: Here's where sometimes being a general manager or coach - and having that built-in affinity for raw, unmistakable talent - comes in handy. Because even though Newton had burst into America's football consciousness in 2010 by becoming the first SEC player to throw for more than 2,000 yards and rush for more than 1,000, leading Auburn to a 14-0 record and the national title, there were some who believed his ridiculous physical skills might work against him. ""You have to be talented to be an NFL quarterback, no doubt,"" Gruden said earlier this season. ""But you have to have that something else. And when you have the most talent and that something else ... you have Cam Newton."" Football is a fickle beast, of course, and so Newton's shelf life as a physical freak may be much shorter than [James]' - for all the pounding [LeBron] absorbs on flights to the basket,a month's worth of drives don't add up to three plunges into an NFL line.

There's embarrassment: How do I stay humble while rooting for the best team? There's fear: What if the best team doesn't win the Super Bowl?

I never saw myself as Rizzo, because as a kid watching the movie, Rizzo's mean. The older you get the more you appreciate her fierceness. I'm very bubbly most of the time and really nice, but I'm honest and I'm frank and that's what Rizzo is. It's such a fun character to play. [Manson] is big again. Last year we had the series ""Aquarius."" Now we have ""Manson's Lost Girls,"" the story of the women he taught to steal and kill. They are: Susan Atkins (Eden Brolin), Squeaky Fromme (Grace Victoria Cox), Linda Kasabian (Mackenzie Mauzy), Patricia Krenwinkel (Isabel Shill) and Leslie Van Houten (Greer Grammer). The story kicks off with Linda's arrival at the Spahn Ranch hippie commune. Taken with Manson, she is soon drawn into a life of crime, notably theft, in what they called ""creepy crawls."" Linda reluctantly becomes an accomplice in Manson's ""Helter Skelter"" murder spree that claimed the life of actress Sharon Tate. She ultimately breaks away and turns herself in as a witness for the prosecution and helps to convict Manson.Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Fleming, author of ""The Fixers: Eddie Mannix, Howard Strickling and the MGM Publicity Machine."" Mannix probably would have ended up a low-level mobster buried in the Meadowlands had he not gone to work for Nick Schenck in 1919. Schenck owned amusement parks and movie houses. Mannix became his right-hand man. When Schenck acquired MGM in a deal, he dispatched Mannix to Los Angeles to keep tabs on the studio, and Mayer in particular. The legendary movie producer may not have known it at the time, but a copy of every telegram he wrote wound up on Mannix's desk. Things got ugly when [George Reeves] fell in love with a socialite and broke [Toni]'s heart. There was a party at Reeves' house one night. By morning, he was dead - shot in the head. It was ruled a suicide, though many books (including Fleming's) posit it was almost certainly a murder. Some have fingered Mannix. Fleming argues that it was the socialite. In any case, Mannix didn't want Toni mixed up with a murder. So he painted another suicide. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
